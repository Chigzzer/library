# Library Project
A simple online library, with no memory capabilities. The user can add books to the page via the po-up form. I have produced a rating system that allows the user to dynamically change the rating they give the book.

Rather than the initial task of displaying all the information of the book on the home page, the details are in the book, which you can access by clicking the book title.

## What to work on
* Font of the site
* CSS and layout of the books
* Make the site look better.
* Understand the colour choices of the site.
* Implement a memory system (back-end) to store each user's library
